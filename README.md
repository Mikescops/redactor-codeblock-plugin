# ðŸ–¹ Redactor Codeblock Plugin
Imperavi Redactor Plugin for adding Code Blocks in your toolbar (multiple languages supported).

This plugin creates `<pre><code></code></pre>` tags that allows [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) to style your code depending on the language.

## Usage

A new button is available in the Redactor toolbar, to insert a new code block, the dropdown will suggest you a pre-selected list of languages for syntax highlighting.

You can select text in your content to convert it to a code block.

You can also remove a codeblock by putting your cursor on it and select any language in the dropdown.


## Supporting more languages

In the script, you can edit the `this.languages` to add more code languages to it, the ones you're likely to use.

The are around 196 languages supported, [check them here](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/).
